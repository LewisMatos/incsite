2020 awards, providing $55 million to fund eight innovative projects
involving 20 participating CUNY campuses designed to connect academic
excellence with entrepreneurship and local economic
development. Projects were selected through a competitive process
utilizing staff from CUNY and Empire State Development and will
support the creation of more than 3,800 jobs over six years.</p>
<p>"The students at New York City’s public colleges and universities have
provided the world with game-changing ideas in fields ranging from
healthcare to manufacturing. Through the CUNY2020 program we are
maximizing those ideas to create economic opportunity for New
Yorkers,” Governor Cuomo said. “The first round of CUNY 2020 projects
will help link some of our best and brightest students with positions
in high-tech sectors, while leveraging their academic excellence to
support economic development and create new opportunities throughout
the New York City area. By funding these eight projects we are making
an investment in New York’s future, and I am proud to present these
awards to the first round of CUNY 2020 recipients.”</p>
<p>CUNY Chancellor James B. Milliken said, “We commend Governor Cuomo and
the State of New York for investing in The City University of New York
with CUNY 2020. CUNY has developed and implemented many public/private
partnerships and this vitally important initiative will continue to
grow the economy, create employment opportunities, and expand our
research and development in all five boroughs. This is a great day for
the University and all New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>The NY CUNY 2020 program links the knowledge and innovation of higher
education to regional economic revitalization, and the Governor
appropriated $55 million as part of the 2013-14 State Budget for NY
CUNY 2020. The program offers grants for 2- and 4-year colleges within
the CUNY system for projects that connect economic development and
academic excellence. Projects are selected in a competitive manner
based on economic impact, advancement of academic goals, innovation,
and collaboration.</p>
<p>Advanced Manufacturing for Economic Development (awarded $1.5
million): Queensborough Community College; Queens College</p>
<p>This project will develop an Advanced Manufacturing Center focused on
3-D printing, to be renovated and equipped within 6 months with 3-D
printing equipment. Students will gain the skills to design and
produce sophisticated components through collaboration with the Queens
College Computer Science Department and local high schools, which will
create new courses for students to learn sophisticated program and
parts processes.</p>
<p>3-D printing is a technological process that can considerably lower
manufacturing costs and return companies to the domestic
market. Manufacturers need workers, as several hundred graduates over
a 5 year period will be produced in this emerging technology,
manufacturers will have increased capability to produce parts
domestically that are currently developed overseas.</p>
